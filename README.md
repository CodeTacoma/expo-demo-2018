# expo-demo-2018
Resources from meetup on 12/22/18

### Getting Started:
These instructions are nothing special and basically snippets from the respective tools docs.

1.  [Make sure you have Node installed.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10475651/how-to-tell-if-node-js-is-installed-or-not)  
[If not you can download it here.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
[What is npm? Read more.](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

2.  [Getting Started with React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html), we'll go the Expo route as you may have guessed.  
    
3.  Prepare to be blown away with how fast you can see your changes when building a mobile app.  
No more 3 minute builds to check a UI change!

4.  Interested in examples of stuff made with React Native?  
[Checkout the React Native Awesome](http://www.awesome-react-native.com/).  
There's also lists of tools used in popular projects for things like storage, payments and styling.

5.  What about a backend?  
I've used [Firebase, Google's platform](https://firebase.google.com/) and [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/), there's also [Microsoft's App Center](https://appcenter.ms/) which I've heard good things about.

6. React Native includes a performance hit when compared to native code.  
This is often cited as one of the biggest drawbacks, [read more about it here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/performance.html#common-sources-of-performance-problems).
